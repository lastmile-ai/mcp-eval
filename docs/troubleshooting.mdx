### Commands

- Doctor: `mcp-eval doctor [--full]` — system/config/env checks, test reports, suggestions
  - [doctor.py](../src/mcp_eval/cli/doctor.py)
- Validate: `mcp-eval validate [--quick]` — API keys, judge config, servers, agents
  - [validate.py](../src/mcp_eval/cli/validate.py)
- Issue: `mcp-eval issue` — prepares a GitHub issue with diagnostics
  - [issue.py](../src/mcp_eval/cli/issue.py)

### Common issues

- MCP server not found: ensure command/URL is correct; try `mcp-eval validate --servers`
- Missing API keys: set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` or add `mcpeval.secrets.yaml`
- No tools recorded: ensure agent `server_names` include your server and that it is reachable
- Timeouts/slow tests: use performance assertions; run with markers to skip slow/network
- Inconsistent outputs: tighten prompts, reduce creativity, prefer objective evaluators
